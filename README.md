# IoT Based Smart Pond Monitoring System UI

Welcome to the **Smart Pond Monitoring System** â€” an IoT-based platform for intelligent aquatic ecosystem management. This system provides real-time insights, precision control, and data-driven decision-making to optimize the health of your pond.

## Features

- **Temperature Control**: Monitor and maintain optimal water temperatures.
- **pH Optimization**: Ensure the correct pH levels for a thriving aquatic environment.
- **Water Level Management**: Keep track of water levels to prevent overflow or drought.
- **Rainfall Tracking**: Stay informed about weather conditions affecting the pond.
- **Oxygen Saturation Monitoring**: Manage oxygen levels for healthy aquatic life.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Utilize data to make informed decisions about pond management.

## Introduction

The **Smart Pond Monitoring System** modernizes traditional pond and aquaculture management with IoT integration. It offers real-time data, automating many aspects of pond care to improve efficiency and environmental sustainability.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with Angular for the user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Spring Boot for RESTful API services.
- **Database**: MySQL is used for data storage.
- **IoT Integration**: Sensors connected to monitor temperature, pH, water levels, oxygen saturation, and more.
- **Icons**: FontAwesome icons are used throughout the user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
3. Start the Angular development server for the frontend.
4. Launch the Spring Boot application for backend services.

## Usage

- **User Dashboard**: Log in as a user or admin to access the main dashboard.
- **Pond Management**: View and manage multiple ponds with sensor data for each.
- **Sensor Data**: Access real-time sensor details such as temperature, pH, and oxygen levels for each pond.

## Pond Management

Manage your ponds by viewing all registered ponds on the dashboard. Each pond has detailed sensor data that helps you make informed decisions about water quality and ecosystem health.

## Sensor Details

The system integrates sensors that provide real-time information about pond conditions. These sensors track important metrics like temperature, pH levels, water levels, oxygen saturation, and rainfall. The data is displayed in a user-friendly layout for easy monitoring.
